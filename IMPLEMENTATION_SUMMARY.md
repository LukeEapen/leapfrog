## 🔄 Three-Section Workflow

### User Experience Flow:
1. **Start**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5001/three-section`
2. **Upload PRD**: Upload a PRD document (.txt, .docx, .pdf, .md) or enter requirements manually
3. **Epic Generation**: System processes the PRD and automatically generates comprehensive epics
4. **Epic Selection**: Generated epics appear in left section → Click to select
5. **User Story Selection**: Stories for selected epic appear in middle → Click to select  
6. **Story Details**: Full details appear in right section with:
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Requirements traceability
   - Chat refinement options
   - Jira submission

### Technical Architecture:
```
Frontend (HTML/JS) ←→ Flask Backend ←→ OpenAI Agents ←→ Vector DB (optional)
                                    ↓
                               Jira Integration
