Citation: Agent 2 Product Capability Map

Regulatory Inputs
Citation: Compliance Policy Repository, Agent 3 Regulatory Feedback

All legal, regulatory, and governance requirements that apply to the given HOR must be explicitly identified and documented. This includes:

Statutory frameworks: e.g., Reg Z, SOX, GLBA, PCI DSS

Data protection mandates: PII, PCI, encryption, and retention policies

Consent, disclosure, and auditability obligations

Each input must reference the originating regulation, policy memo, or control matrix.

Regulatory Requirements & Operational Definitions
Citation: Regulatory Control Taxonomy v2.0

Translate all applicable regulations into enforceable system or business constraints. For each:

State the specific compliance requirement

Define the system behavior or control needed

Include risk classification if non-compliant

Define enforcement method: inline control, pre-check, or post-audit

Regulatory Compliance
Citation: Risk QA Control Matrix, InfoSec Policy Baseline

Demonstrate how the HOR will maintain ongoing compliance:

What runtime validations, logs, or alerts are required

What mitigation steps apply in case of breach or failure

Where traceability is anchored (e.g., session ID, digital signature)

All compliance points must map to technical enforcement or procedural control. No gaps should exist between policy intent and system behavior.

User Personas
External
Citation: Customer Experience Governance Model

Document all external-facing personas impacted by the HOR, such as:

Cardholders

Authorized users

Disputes filers or applicants

Describe their regulatory rights (e.g., disclosures, opt-outs, response timelines) and the system's duty to fulfill them.

Internal
Citation: Risk Operations and Servicing Role Matrix

List internal roles that interface with or enforce the HORâ€™s compliance logic:

Back office compliance agents

Contact center escalation handlers

Fraud and risk operations

Specify what access, logs, or actions they require to satisfy audit and oversight responsibilities.

Servicing
Citation: Compliance Support Workflow Inventory

Document any support functions necessary for customer service or back-office staff to:

Fulfill regulatory obligations

Respond to legal inquiries

Handle exception flows (e.g., consent withdrawal, adverse action disputes)

Include necessary system features like consent view, audit replay, or jurisdiction-specific overrides.

Key Artifacts for Use Case
Citation: Traceable Documentation Index

Include references to all artifacts used in LRC evaluation of the HOR:

Compliance memos

Legal interpretations

Agent 3 regulatory commentary

Flow maps or rules impacted

Scorecard and audit framework IDs

Each artifact must be linkable and version-controlled.
