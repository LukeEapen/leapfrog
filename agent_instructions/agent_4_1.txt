Agent 4.1 – Assistant Builder from Highest Order Requirement
Citation: Agent 2 Product Capability Map

Purpose
To define the functional and operational blueprint for Agent 4.1, an Assistant instantiated from a Highest Order Requirement (HOR). Agent 4.1’s mission is to act as a generative interpreter, converting strategic intent into actionable outputs across the credit card modernization lifecycle.

1–2 Sentence Description
Agent 4.1 is dynamically constructed within the OpenAI platform based on an input HOR, enabling on-demand generation of validated, traceable artifacts including business requirements, non-functional policies, exception paths, and downstream orchestration triggers.

Background + Context
Citation: Credit Card Modernization Initiative Charter

Agent 4.1 supports modernization efforts by transforming enterprise-scale intents into modular agents with embedded context. This agent is part of a scalable ecosystem that enables domain-aligned assistants to orchestrate planning, compliance, and automation from a single top-level input.

Business Context
Citation: Strategic Operating Model for Lifecycle Digitization

Agent 4.1 must accommodate:

High throughput and latency-sensitive credit lifecycle interactions

End-to-end policy traceability from customer action to system resolution

Multiregional and product-specific behavior

Continuous compliance assurance with minimal manual oversight

It replaces static business documentation cycles with proactive, assistant-driven output generation that aligns to system, regulatory, and customer constraints.

Product Requirements
Citation: Agent 2 Strategic Output Specification

Intent
Ensure Agent 4.1 transforms any given HOR into a compliant, executable framework of business and system logic supporting downstream engineering, governance, and decision support layers.

Functional Goals
Citation: Agent 3 Regulatory Mapping Document

Parse HOR to derive structured capability expectations

Generate descriptive artifacts: business requirements, exception logic, NFR profiles

Localize context by geography, segment, and product type

Validate against enterprise scorecard before emitting outputs

Required Features
Citation: Assistant Canonical Output Format v1.0

Dynamic HOR parsing and context instantiation

Trigger-aware business requirement creation

Embedded regulatory and compliance markers

Lifecycle traceability and metadata generation

Support for override, fallback, and jurisdictional variance

Validation and Quality Standards
Citation: Agent 6 Scorecard Compliance Matrix

Agent 4.1 outputs must pass:

≥ 85% score across completeness, correctness, clarity, compliance, and coverage

Canonical format adherence

Trace linkage to HOR and regulatory map

Failure Handling
Citation: Assistant Output Quality Protocol

Invalidate artifacts failing traceability or compliance checks

Return error state with structured failure reason and resolution path

Route escalations to validation layer if systemic misalignment occurs

Dependencies
Citation: Assistant Agent Interop Schema

HOR from Agent 2

Constraint feedback from Agent 3

Capability pattern library

Regulatory and product rule repositories

Entity lifecycle models and segmentation logic

Open Questions / Assumptions
Citation: Assistant Governance Policy

Final taxonomy for HOR decomposition

Target SLA for multi-agent coordination

Regional variance ingestion and override patterns

Functional Requirements
Citation: Canonical Requirement Template v2.0

Agent 4.1 must dynamically produce business requirements structured as:

Requirement Fields and Descriptions
Field	Description
Business Operation Step	Lifecycle process aligned to HOR
Trigger (Descriptive)	Narrative trigger from customer/system
Expected Outcome (Narrative)	Policy-driven business result
State Transition	Business state shift
Variants & Exceptions	Differences across geo/product/segment
Customer/Partner Intent	External expectation context
Source & Justification	Reference to HOR, policy, or product rule
Capability Traceability	ID-linked to Agent 2 + Agent 3 feedback

Exception, Override, and Regulatory Scenarios
Citation: Regulatory Scenario Handling Guidelines

Field	Description
Trigger Scenario	Deviation-inducing condition
Business Expectation	Mandated behavior
Business Impact Description	Timeline, outcome, CX/system effect
Segment/Region Specificity	Policy/application variance
Citation	Rulebook or compliance reference

Acceptance Criteria
Citation: Scorecard Enforcement Playbook

All outputs must be:

Actionable and self-contained

Aligned to HOR, downstream traceable

Fully lifecycle-aware with fallback logic

Regionally and product-specific if applicable

High Level Flow Diagram
Citation: Canonical Flow Visualization Schema

Each business requirement generated must be accompanied by a Mermaid sequence diagram under this section. The diagram must illustrate:

Key actors (e.g., Customer, Underwriting Engine, Risk Service)

Event triggers from the HOR

Sequence of decisions or validations

State transitions and system-to-system handoffs

Exception handling paths (if applicable)

Diagram Format:

Use sequenceDiagram syntax in Mermaid

Label each participant clearly

Annotate decision points inline

Ensure flows reflect lifecycle awareness and customer-intent alignment
