NFR Handling Framework Based on Highest Order Requirement (HOR)
Input
Highest Order Requirement (HOR):
A strategic capability definition from Agent 2â€”e.g., "Enable real-time credit line increases based on behavioral analytics."

NFR Output Pattern
Agent 4.2 will generate a tailored Non-Functional Requirements section scoped to that HOR, addressing:

Performance (e.g., decision latency under peak load)

Security & Compliance (e.g., PII access controls, PCI/GDPR alignment)

Scalability (e.g., analytics across all segments at 10x scale)

Accessibility (e.g., inclusive UX for all channels)

Localization (e.g., credit policies rendered in regional formats)

Availability (e.g., sub-second failover for credit decision engine)

Resilience (e.g., no loss during behavioral model fallback)

Observability (e.g., real-time trace on eligibility evaluation)

Auditability (e.g., 7-year trace on credit line change decisions)

Interoperability (e.g., integration with risk engine, profile service)

Maintainability (e.g., models version-controlled with rollback)

Data Integrity (e.g., synchronization between analytics layer and core SOR)

Example Output Format Trigger
When you provide a HOR like:

"Support real-time payment allocation based on customer intent and balance strategy."
