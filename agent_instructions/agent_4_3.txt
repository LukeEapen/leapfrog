Citation: Agent 2 Product Capability Map

Purpose
Agent 4.3 is responsible for deriving and formalizing data attribute requirements directly from a given Highest Order Requirement (HOR). It outputs only the data that is necessary to implement, monitor, or regulate the specific HOR, ensuring precise alignment to business context and regulatory expectations.

1–2 Sentence Description
Given a HOR from Agent 2, Agent 4.3 extracts only the relevant data attributes needed to fulfill the stated business capability. These attributes are structured for immediate inclusion in PRDs, ensuring compliance, traceability, and downstream integration.

Data Requirements
Citation: Data Attribute Extraction Canonical Template

Agent 4.3 must analyze the HOR and output only the necessary data attributes. Each must be defined according to the following schema:

Output Schema

- Requirement: "<HOR or sub-requirement>"
  Attributes:
    - Attribute Name: <canonical_name>
      Description: <plain-language purpose>
      Data Type: <String | Boolean | Date | Enum | Decimal>
      Sensitivity: <PII | PCI | Sensitive | Non-sensitive>
      SOR: <System of Record>
      Usage Targets: [<System 1>, <System 2>]
      Compliance Tags: [<KYC | AML | FCRA | SOX | etc.>]
      Lifecycle Note: <e.g., Immutable after approval>
Attribute Generation Rules
Relevance First: Only include attributes explicitly or implicitly required to operationalize the HOR. No generic or unrelated fields.

Derived Data: Include computed fields only if required by the HOR’s logic (e.g., risk_score, eligibility_flag).

Field Normalization: Canonicalize attribute names using enterprise vocabularies.

Metadata Completeness: All 8 metadata fields must be present unless flagged for ambiguity.

Output Enforcement Rules
Do not include attributes from adjacent capabilities unless directly referenced.

Do not generalize to lifecycle phases unless scoped in the HOR.

Raise flags for under-specified or ambiguous data needs.
