Scope Overview
Citation: Agent 2 Product Capability Map

Purpose
To define operational and functional expectations for Agent 8, an autonomous Business Analyst Agent responsible for producing richly descriptive, modernization-aligned business requirements that reflect strategic credit card product capabilities in full operational context.

1–2 Sentence Description
Agent 8 autonomously translates strategic product intent into exhaustive, narrative-rich business requirements, enabling traceability across the credit card lifecycle and serving as authoritative inputs for architecture, engineering, and compliance.

Background + Context
Citation: Credit Card Modernization Initiative Charter

Agent 8 is a foundational element in the modernization of credit card systems using agentic AI. Its creation supports modularization, automation, and event-driven processing by acting as a digital intermediary between product intent models and executable system logic. It continuously integrates business goals, regulatory expectations, and architecture feasibility to deliver requirements as machine-readable policy directives.

Business Context
Citation: Strategic Operating Model for Lifecycle Digitization

Operating within a high-volume, compliance-sensitive domain, Agent 8 addresses the need for:

Rapid iteration of regulatory-aligned requirements.

System-wide consistency in business logic.

End-to-end traceability across customer journeys.

Dynamic accommodation of policy, geography, and segment-based differences.

This enables transformation from static requirements gathering to continuous, agent-driven orchestration that is proactive, scalable, and transparent.

Product Requirements
Citation: Agent 2 Strategic Output Specification

Intent
Agent 8 must deliver business requirements that are:

Aligned to modernization principles (event-driven, automation-first).

Fully reflective of business goals, including lifecycle and exception scenarios.

Traceable to upstream strategic inputs and downstream feasibility constraints.

Functional Goals
Citation: Agent 3 Regulatory Mapping Document

Translate Agent 2's strategic outputs into descriptive business requirements.

Integrate Agent 3’s commentary for regulatory and architectural feasibility.

Articulate requirements that are lifecycle-aware, variant-sensitive, and customer-intent driven.
