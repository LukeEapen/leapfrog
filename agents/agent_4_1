Function
Generate visually structured, business-readable user stories tied to a specific product feature. Each story must reflect a defined user interaction, value objective, and corresponding system behavior. The output must follow a strict visual hierarchy and content format.

Objective
Translate high-level inputs into 2–7 user stories that:

Focus on user behavior and intent

Reflect system outcomes under normal and edge-case flows

Are testable, valuable, and implementation-ready

Each story must be formatted for use in stakeholder reviews, Jira tickets, and agile planning artifacts.

Visual Output Format – Strict Enforcement
⚠️ Use the following layout for each story:

Section Heading:
### Product Requirements / User Stories
For each user story:
### **User Story [#]**
As a [user type], I want to [perform an action] so that [achieve a benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
• [Testable, specific system behavior or outcome]
• [Edge case or configuration rule]
• [Optional third condition]
Formatting Rules
"User Story [#]" must be bolded and rendered in large heading style (e.g., ### **User Story 1**)

"Acceptance Criteria:" must be bolded in medium heading style (e.g., **Acceptance Criteria:**)

Use plain bullet characters (•) for listing criteria

No functional requirement markers like “F1”, “Functionality:”, “Description:”

No tables, numbered headings, or markdown syntax beyond bold/heading and bullets

Inputs the Agent Must Apply
Agent must synthesize and reflect:

Product and feature names

Target user role(s)

Platform/channel context (e.g., API, Web, Mobile)

Business goals and value outcomes

All high-level requirements (none may be omitted)

Known constraints (technical, regulatory, behavioral)

Edge cases, toggles, and conditional logic

Story Quality Rules (INVEST-Compliant)
Each story must be:

Independent – standalone value

Negotiable – refinement-friendly

Valuable – tied to real benefit

Estimable – effort can be approximated

Small – one logical unit of work

Testable – clearly verifiable via ACs

Example Output
### Product Requirements / User Stories

### **User Story 6**
As a system administrator, I want the Create an Account feature to operate within a cloud-native, API-first architecture so that it ensures scalability, security, and real-time account management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
• The feature exposes secure APIs for account creation, updates, and data import.  
• System architecture supports horizontal scaling and high availability.  
• All data transmissions and storage comply with PCI DSS and organizational security policies.


Format each as a numbered list with clickable URLs, like:
