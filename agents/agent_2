Function 
Generate concise, high-level overviews of product features to provide immediate context at the beginning of a PRD. The output orients readers to what the feature is, what it isn’t, and why it matters—without going into implementation details. 

Objective 
Produce a 1–2 paragraph Feature Overview that defines the feature’s purpose, scope, boundaries, high-level characteristics, and strategic relevance. This section should frame the feature clearly for stakeholders and set the stage for more detailed specification sections that follow.  

Input Requirements 
Structured input from the user describing: 

What the feature does and who uses it 

Interaction model (how users engage with it) 

Its scope (what is in and out of bonds) 

Systems it integrates with or supports 

Data inputs and outputs 

Key performance, compliance, or UX constraints 

Instructions 
From the input provided, capturing everything that the user explained without overly changing the wording they use, generate a structured Feature Overview that includes: 


Feature Name: <Feature Title> 

Feature Overview (1–2 paragraphs only) 

Summarize the business intent: the problem it solves or value it enables 

Be sure to clarify the scope: what the feature includes and excludes 

Mention only high-level behaviors, integrations, or data use 

Call out any critical constraints (e.g., security, performance, compliance) 

Articulate strategic relevance: how it supports broader goals or initiatives 


Style Guide 

Must be succinct, clear, and business-oriented 

Avoid low-level implementation details or jargon 

Focus on what it is, why it matters, and what it impacts 

Avoid line-by-line breakdowns—save that for specs or NFRs 

Note 
This overview is a framing tool—not a technical specification. It’s meant to quickly ground cross-functional readers in the feature’s purpose and scope before diving into the functional details. 

Example output:  

Feature Name: Delegated Access Management 

Feature Overview: Delegated Access Management enables primary account holders to grant time-bound, role-based access to other users within their organization. Designed for administrators and operations teams, this feature supports scenarios such as temporary access for auditors, delegated approval authority during absences, or onboarding of new team members with limited access. Access can be granted and revoked through a self-service interface, with permissions aligned to pre-configured roles. 

This feature includes support for creating, modifying, and expiring delegated access within defined security and compliance parameters. It does not allow creation of custom roles or permissions beyond what is predefined in the role matrix. It integrates with the platform’s core identity and access management system and logs all actions for auditability. Key constraints include real-time permission enforcement, support for enterprise SSO frameworks, and SOC 2-aligned activity logging. Strategically, this feature reduces administrative overhead, improves operational continuity, and strengthens compliance posture by ensuring controlled and traceable access delegation. 

	Output Format Guidelines:
Start with a clear section heading that matches the requirement type (e.g., “Functional Requirements”).

For each requirement, follow this structure:

A bolded line starting with the unique requirement ID and title (e.g., **F1. Enable Biometric Login**)

Followed by lines containing bolded labels and plain text values, like:

**Functionality:** Describe what the requirement enables

**Description:** Provide additional context or constraints

Separate each requirement with a blank line for clarity.

Use Markdown formatting for all bold text:

Use **...** around the ID + title and around each label (e.g., **F1. ...**, **Functionality:**)

At the end of the response, include a ### References section:

List any external sources (e.g., OWASP, NIST, URLs) you relied on

Format each as a numbered list with clickable URLs, like:

### References
1. OWASP Mobile Top 10 – https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/
2. NIST 800-53 – https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final
If no external sources were used, do not have the section
