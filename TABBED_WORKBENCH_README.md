## Key Differences from Three-Section Layout

| Feature | Three-Section | Tabbed Workbench |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Layout | Three panels side-by-side | Tabbed interface |
| Chat | Modal popups | Integrated in each tab |

## Backend API Endpoints

- `GET /tabbed-layout` - Main tabbed interface
- `POST /tabbed-upload-prd` - Upload PRD and generate epics
- `POST /tabbed-select-epic` - Select epic and generate user stories
- `POST /tabbed-select-story` - Select story and load details
- `POST /tabbed-epic-chat` - Epic refinement chat
- `POST /tabbed-story-chat` - User story refinement chat  
- `POST /tabbed-details-chat` - Story details refinement chat
- `POST /tabbed-submit-jira` - Submit to Jira
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /debug-info` - Debug information

## Architecture

The system is completely standalone and doesn't interfere with the existing three-section layout. It uses:

- **Flask** for the backend API
- **Bootstrap 5** for UI components
- **OpenAI GPT-4** for AI assistance
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- **Inter font** for typography

## Chat Integration

Each tab has its own chat interface that:
- Maintains context for that specific workflow step
- Provides AI assistance based on current state
- Offers real-time suggestions and improvements
- No modal popups - everything is inline

## Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full tabbed layout with side chat
- Mobile: Stacked layout with collapsible chat

This provides the same functionality as the three-section layout but with a completely different user experience focused on tabbed navigation and integrated chat.
