|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Requirements / User Stories | Interest Calculation           | Calculate interest on card balances          | The system must calculate interest on card balances based on transaction dates, balances, and payment status.|
| Product Requirements / User Stories | Transaction Posting            | Post daily transaction records                | The system must post daily transactions to update customer, card, and account records accordingly.           |
| Product Requirements / User Stories | Account Update                | Accept and process account updates            | The system must accept account update requests and validate input data before applying changes.              |
| Functional Requirements           | Input Data Handling            | Read transaction, customer, card, account files | The system reads multiple indexed and sequential files containing transactions, customer, card, and account data.|
| Functional Requirements           | Interest Calculation Logic     | Compute daily interest rate and interest amount| Interest is computed using an annual percentage rate divided by 365, multiplied by balance and days elapsed. |
| Functional Requirements           | Payment Status Check           | Skip interest if previous payment was full   | Interest calculation is bypassed if the previous payment was made in full.                                   |
| Functional Requirements           | Transaction Posting Process    | Sequentially process daily transaction file  | Transactions are read sequentially and posted to update relevant records in indexed files.                  |
| Functional Requirements           | Error Handling                 | Monitor file status and handle EOF conditions| The system monitors file statuses for errors and end-of-file conditions during processing.                   |
| Non-Functional Requirements       | Batch Processing              | Execute as batch COBOL programs                | All programs run in batch mode for scheduled processing of transactions and interest calculations.          |
| Non-Functional Requirements       | Performance                   | Sequential and random access file operations | Use indexed files for random access and sequential files for batch processing to optimize performance.      |
| Data Requirements                 | File Structures               | Use indexed and sequential files for data storage | Data is stored in multiple files: transaction, customer, card, account, cross-reference, and discount group files.|
| Data Requirements                 | Key Fields                   | Use card number, account ID, transaction ID as keys | Files are keyed by card number, account ID, or transaction ID for efficient access and updates.              |
| Legal, Regulatory, Compliance Requirements | Data Privacy                 | Protect customer and card data                 | Customer and card data must be handled securely, complying with data protection regulations.                 |

2025-08-29 10:24:31,036 [INFO] root: Agent 1.1 Output: **Product Overview**

This product is an in-house credit card core platform designed to replace a legacy third-party system, enabling comprehensive control over credit issuance, account management, and servicing for the U.S. credit card market. It serves financial services providers focused on full lifecycle management of credit card products, supporting real-time issuance of both virtual and physical cards. The system encompasses essential credit functionality including credit line management, product setup, authorizations, settlements, and other integral processes that uphold the operational needs of modern credit card services.

Strategically, this solution delivers enterprise-grade control and agility by consolidating critical credit card management within a unified platform tailored for rigorous U.S. regulatory and business environments. By covering specialized use cases such as charged-off account creation and management, it addresses key post-default scenarios with compliance and operational efficiency. This transition away from legacy systems aligns with business goals for improved ownership, faster time-to-market, enhanced data integrity, and scalable transaction performance, positioning the company competitively in a dynamic financial services sector.

2025-08-29 10:24:31,037 [INFO] root: Agent 2 Output: Feature Name: Create a Frontbook Charged-Off Account

Feature Overview:  
The "Create a Frontbook Charged-Off Account" feature enables the management of credit card accounts that have transitioned from good standing to charged-off status within the in-house credit card core system. This capability supports the full lifecycle of charged-off accounts, triggered by events such as prolonged delinquency, customer death, or bankruptcy. It is a specialized subset of the broader account creation and management functionality, designed to operate seamlessly within the modern core platform that handles credit lines, product setup, authorizations, settlements, and related processes.

This feature includes the ability to instantiate charged-off accounts with appropriate status flags and lifecycle controls but excludes the initial account origination for accounts in good standing. It integrates with the core credit issuance and servicing systems to ensure real-time updates and consistent data handling. Critical constraints include compliance with financial regulations on charged-off account reporting and secure handling of sensitive customer data. Strategically, this feature supports the broader initiative to fully own credit issuance and account servicing, enabling improved operational control, risk management, and regulatory compliance by replacing legacy third-party systems with a modern, integrated platform.
